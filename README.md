# Old-Unity-Projects
A repository where I will upload all of the projects I have left. There are many more that have been lost to time.

# Projects
    -> Orbit Test - 2021.2.18f1 - Last update 24.12.2022
    The most complete of all my projects. It was an attempt in making a fully newtonian
    physics sandbox. I completed all of the physics parts and main features, I just never
    made it an actual game.
    
    There are still bugs but I'm extremely happy with how optimized I could make the game. 
    WARNING : Planets will stutter if fps is lower than physics framerate, toggle an option in the main menu to couple them together.
